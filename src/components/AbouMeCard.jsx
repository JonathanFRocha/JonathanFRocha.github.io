      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software development student at Trybe, currently living in Belo Horizonte, Brasil. my
        first contact with code was when I was 14, creating new features for my game server, and
        since i got in touch with the development world again iâ€™ve been passionate about testing and
        creating things. I really like gaming with my friends and spending time with those I hold
        dear, also I LOVE to challenge myself by creating and collaborating with things that I find
        difficult to overcome because the feeling that comes after succeeding is the best.
