            I am a software development student at Trybe, currently living in Belo Horizonte,
            Brasil.

            My first contact with code was when I was 14, creating new features for my game server,
            and since i got in touch with the development world again iâ€™ve been passionate about
            testing and creating things.

            I really like gaming with my friends and spending time with those I hold dear, also I
            LOVE to challenge myself by creating and collaborating with things that I find difficult
            to overcome because the feeling that comes after succeeding is the best.
